Recommended Packages
rbx-reader

Parses both .rbxl (binary) and .rbxm files.

Written in TypeScript, works in Node.js and can be adapted for browser usage.

Example:

js
const fs = require("node:fs");
const reader = require("rbx-reader");
const buf = fs.readFileSync("./path/to/file.rbxl");
const result = reader.parseBuffer(buf);
This is suitable for binary place files and is actively maintained.

rbxlx (npm)

Designed for parsing .rbxlx (XML) files.

Converts the file into a user-friendly tree of objects, making inspection and analysis easy.

Example usage:

js
const rbxlx = require("rbxlx");
const fs = require("fs");
rbxlx.parse(fs.readFileSync("test.rbxlx"))
  .then(tree => {
    const parts = tree.getDescendants().filter(obj => obj.class === "Part");
    // display or analyze parts
  });
Works well for browser and Node.js environments, particularly for RBXLX format.

rbxBinaryParser

For browser-based or server-side parsing of .rbxl (binary) and .rbxm files as ArrayBuffers.

Returns a decoded object containing the full Roblox instance structure.

Usage Notes
For RBXL (binary): Use rbx-reader or rbxBinaryParser as these can decode Robloxâ€™s binary file structure into objects for analysis.

For RBXLX (XML): Use rbxlx npm package, as it is specialized for readable XML parsing and structural breakdown.
