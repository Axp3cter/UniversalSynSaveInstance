# Interface Guidelines

For more information about Cascade’s Human Interface Guidelines, refer to [Apple’s Official HIG documentation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/), which Cascade is based on.

## Why is this important?

Following established interface guidelines is essential to building high-quality user interfaces. While visually appealing components are important, it's equally critical to **understand how and when to use them.**

Cascade adopts Apple's Human Interface Guidelines to promote consistency, clarity, and intentional design. *By understanding these principles*, you can create polished interfaces that are consistent with a user's everyday interface navigation experience. Knowing how to use components correctly leads to better user experiences and more maintainable UI systems.
