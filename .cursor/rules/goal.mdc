# USSI Rewrite


## Goal

Rewrite the old USSI code ( .cursor\data\old\saveinstance.luau ) to be made with cascade ui and project structure and to also support being used without the ui with only logging showing and make proper use of my project structure which is a modified version of cascade ui project structure, it should be a more complex version of the previous code, dont try to introduce new features unless absolutely neccessary for cleaner better code, keep it simple and use packages like cascade for the ui and fusion,promise and tableutil for the internal logic

## Core Requirements

make sure it reads the other projects on parsing binary and xml, for now only try to code/support xml but make the code be able to easily support binary, it should allow both a model or a game file saving
with absolute full coverage and it should also be perfect in its documentation and commentation to include authoratative info for easy comparisons

the structure i have is also the structure of how cascade ui was coded so just go into .cursor\data\Cascade-main and learn about where and how u code stuff

## Development Standards ( ALWAYS AS AGGRESSIVE AND THOROUGH AND COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE WITH NO DEVIATIONS )

- Code Quality: Build from scratchâ€”use `.cursor/data` only as reference, dont just copy and paste. Verify implementations against multiple sources by reading atleast 3 different versions of the same code. Include robust error handling and edge case testing.
- Research: Consult diverse sources. Compare multiple reference implementations. Test thoroughly before integration. Apply aggressive code quality and file/folder structuring design principles. keep code modular and clean. always use the latest technologies, packages and standards which u will determine by searching up the latest version of everything
